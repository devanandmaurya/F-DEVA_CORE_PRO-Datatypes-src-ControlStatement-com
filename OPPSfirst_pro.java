//SIX PILLAR OF OPPS
//CLASS, OBJECT, METHOD , INHERITANCE, POLYMORIPHISM, ABSTRACTION , ENCAPSULATION 
//SMALL TALK IS FULLY FIRST TRULLY PROGRAMING LANGUGE .
//CLASS->> CLASS IS  THE COLLECTION OF OBJECT .CLASS IS NOT REAL WORLD ENTITY ,IT IS JUST 
// A TEMPLATE OF BLUEPRINT  , CLASS DOES NOT ACCUPY MEMORY ...

//SYNTEX >>> ACCESS MODIFIER  CLASS  CLASS NAME
//EX PUBLIC CLASS LEAPYEAR
//UNDER CLASS WE HAVE METHOD CONSTRUCTURES ,FIELDS , BLOCK, NESTED CLASS

//METHOD ->"A SET OF CODE WHICH PERFORM A PARTICULAR TASK" WHICH PERFORM A SPECIFIC TASK. 
//IG > ANIMAL HAVING TWO OBJECT  DOG , COW  >
//THE ADVANTAGE IS CODE REUSEBILITY CODE OPTIMIZATION,

//SYNTAX -->>> ACESS MODIFEIR RETURNTYPE METHODNAME(SMALL LATTER) (LIST OF PARAMETER)
//public void getData(int a, String b) {}

//+++++++++++++++++
//OBJECT-> OBJECT IS REAL WORLD ENTITY, IT ACCUPY MEMORY , IT IS INSTANCE OF CLASS , 
//IT CONSIST OF IDENTIY THAT IS ITS NAME
//ITS STATE AND ATTRIBUTE  FOR EXAM DOG IS OBJECT WHICH STATE IS ITS COLOR , AGE, 
// OBJECT HAVE BEHAVER AND IT REPRESENT METHOD  LIKE EAT, RUN 
//++++++++++++


         //++++++++ OBJECT HOW CREATE OBJECT CREATE.
//FIVE WAY 
//BY NEW KEYWORDS
// BY USING CLONE METHODS
// NEW INSTANCE METHOD
//DESIRILAZATION 
//FACTORY METHODS



// THERE ARE THRE STEPE TO CREATE OBJECT THAT IS DECLARATION ..>> Animal buzo
//, INSTANCIALTION  ..>> buzo =new 
//, INITIALIZATION ..>> buzo=new Animal();
//Animal buzo= new Animal();

//  TO call OBJECT BY . OPETRATORS
// buzo.Animal();
